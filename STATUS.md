### Current Milestone

We have successfully **completed Milestone 1** and are now beginning **Milestone 2: Advanced Syntax & Semantic Validation**.

### Completed Features (Milestone 1)

- **Tag Pair Parsing**: Correctly parses the Seven Tag Roster and other arbitrary tags.
- **Core Movetext Parsing**:
  - Standard Pawn Moves (`e4`)
  - Standard Piece Moves (`Nf3`)
  - Piece Captures (`Nxf3`)
  - Pawn Captures (`exd5`)
  - Checks (`+`) and Checkmates (`#`)
- **Core Data Models**: Established `Game`, `Move`, `Square`, and `PieceType` structs.
- **Project Structure**:
  - A comprehensive `README.md` with installation and usage examples.
  - A `docs/` directory with EBNF grammar.
  - Full GoDoc comments for the public API.
  - A robust, table-driven test suite with high coverage.
- **Architectural Refinements**:
  - The parser has been refactored to use a `Scanner` for efficient tokenization.
  - Common logic has been centralized into an `internal/util` package with its own tests.
- **Move Disambiguation**: The parser now handles movetext like `Rdf8` and `N1c3`.
- **Pawn Promotion**: The parser now handles movetext like `e8=Q` and `exd8=R+`.
- **Castling**: The parser now handles both kingside (`O-O`) and queenside (`O-O-O`) castling.
- **Code Health & Refactoring**: Completed a comprehensive cleanup phase which included:
  - Consolidation of all move-parsing tests into a single table-driven test.
  - Refactoring of the core move parser for robustness and clarity.
  - Hardening of the scanner tests.
  - A full review and update of all GoDoc comments and documentation.

### Next Steps (Milestone 2)

The primary goal of this milestone is to support the full PGN specification.

#### 1. Completed Features (Milestone 2)

- **Comments**: The parser now handles both single-line (`;`) and multi-line (`{...}`) comments by correctly ignoring them.
- **Recursive Annotation Variations (RAVs)**: The parser now correctly handles nested move lines, e.g., `(1. e5 d5)`. The parser was refactored to use a stateful, recursive descent approach.
- **Numeric Annotation Glyphs (NAGs)**: The parser now correctly handles NAGs, e.g., `$1`, `$18`, associating them with the preceding move.

### Milestone 2 Complete

With the implementation of NAGs, all major parsing features for the PGN standard are now complete.

### Next Steps (Milestone 3: Beta Release & Hardening)

The primary goal of this milestone is to prepare the library for a stable v1.0.0 beta release. The focus will shift from adding new features to improving robustness, documentation, and the public API.

#### 1. Immediate Next Step: Final Parser Review & Refinement

- **Task**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire parser and its data structures. Refine the public API, improve GoDoc comments, and ensure all code adheres to our engineering guidelines. This includes a final review of the `parseMove` and `parseCoreMove` functions for clarity and robustness.
- **Files to Update**: All `*.go` files.

#### 2. Upcoming Tasks

- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improve error messages to be more specific and user-friendly, including line and column numbers where possible.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Implement a comprehensive fuzz testing suite for the parser to ensure it can handle any malformed input without crashing.
- **Benchmarking**: Add a suite of benchmarks to measure and track the performance of the parser.
- **Examples**: Create a set of examples in the `examples/` directory to showcase how to use the library.
- **README Overhaul**: Update the `README.md` to reflect the complete feature set and provide a comprehensive guide for new users.
